                            <p>Throughout his tenure in TUD Tallaght Campus, Barry has been involved in software development projects to demonstrate his ability. These projects
                            were both in collaboration with other peers and individually by Barry himself.

                                <p>The Author Collaboration Website was a three person project undetaken by Barry and his peers during the second year of his Computing
                                course. This website was built using Play! framework to create a fullstack web application that allowed its users to create literary content in a collaborative
                                fashion and discuss through forums topics ranging from story ideas to off topic chat. A community shop was also provided through the website to publish and sell
                                community works with customers.

                                   This application will also enable family members to send media files to their elderly relatives in the forms of audio files, images and videos.
                                   Lixer is being built with a combination of ReactJS, WebRTC and google Firebase and eventually will also be offered as an android application.
